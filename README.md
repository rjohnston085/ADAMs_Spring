# ADAMs_Spring
Creation of a multi segment spring to simulate spring collapse and tube wall friction

History:
I had started this project some 7 years ago as I saw it as a fundemental part of a simulation project that I was going to lead. I left before the project started but I'd manage to create a MatLab script to generate a spring coil segment while sitting at home of a night. Now so many years on, I find myself moving away from the technical detail of engineering within the career but would like to maintain all my technical skill sets. Therefore I set out to hopefully achieve a simple but complex engineering simulation.
